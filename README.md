# Rust-OS
Operating System for Raspberry Pi written in Rust based on the Stanford class CS140e: 
https://cs140e.sergio.bz. This repository contains my implemptation of the CS140e 
Raspberry Pi operating system up to the memory allocator. At that point I migrated 
my solutions into this repository: https://github.com/brentward/rustos, which is an 
updated version of the same project.
